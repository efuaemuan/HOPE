HOPE was my first ever web-based project. I created this website for a nonprofit organization I cofounded with 7 of my college mates.
HOPE is an acronym for Helping Other People Everywhere. Our goal was to feed as many homeless and underpriviledged people as possible during that year's Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season. 
After a week of the website being up, we became sponsored by Feeding America, Tampa Bay. 
I created the website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
