Hope7 was a simple website I created for a nonprofit organization I cofounded with 7 of my college mates.
Our goal was to feed as many homeless and underpriviledged people as possible during that year's Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season. 
After a week of the website being up, we became sponsored by Feeding America, Tampa Bay. 
I created the website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
